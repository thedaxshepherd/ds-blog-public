        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intention">Intention<a class="hash-link" href="#intention" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Originally this started as a page on the website that did not change. The idea behind listing out what I was currently working on was that I would have a snapshot of the technology that I was currently using as well as what I was learning. But as I revisited this page, I realized it was going to change over time and really should be a blog post. A good example would be how when I started building Tabular Data Models I spent all my time in Visual Studio. Now I rarely open Visual Studio for developing the data models but still use it for SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="many-hats">Many Hats<a class="hash-link" href="#many-hats" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I work in a small IT shop. This means that I wear many hats. I gather requirements from the business, ETL, develop the data model, write the DAX code, and help with how the data will be presented on the canvas (usually Excel or Power BI). This also means understanding source systems like Netsuite ERP and how the data on the backend is structured. I also have to be self-motivated to learn new skills and apply them to projects I am working on.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sql-server-dba">SQL Server DBA<a class="hash-link" href="#sql-server-dba" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>My main role early on was that of a SQL Server DBA. We have internal applications using SQL Server for the databases. We do not have separate SQL developers so the responsibility of maintaining and fixing all of the SQL stored procedures was part of my responsibilities. I still perform that role in some capacity, but it is not my primary responsibility due to the growth of the Business Intelligence projects.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sql-server">SQL Server<a class="hash-link" href="#sql-server" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I use SQL Server Integration Services to pull the data from the source systems (Custom payroll application, Netsuite ERP, JD Edwards ERP) and store it in SQL Server. I create the databases, tables, and views that are needed.  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="third-party-data-model-tools">Third-Party Data Model Tools<a class="hash-link" href="#third-party-data-model-tools" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I use DAX Studio for testing measures, performance tuning, and querying the data models. For building the data models I use a combination of tools including Tabular Editor, Model Auto Build, and Power BI Desktop. Some of the large models are then deployed to SQL Server Analysis Services. One of the tools I need to learn more about is Bravo.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-the-tabular-data-models">Building the Tabular Data Models<a class="hash-link" href="#building-the-tabular-data-models" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To build the tabular data models, I am using <a href="https://github.com/m-kovalsky/ModelAutoBuild" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model Auto Build</a> which uses an Excel file with the metadata in it. The author describes it as laying out a blueprint of the model before creating it. You can share the Excel file with the business as it gives them insight into what is being created. It is dependent on Tabular Editor to generate the necessary assets. Since it is essentially a C# script, I can make changes to the code if needed and also raise an issue with the author if any bugs are found. Because there is no GUI it requires me to visualize the model and draw out how it should look (yes, I use giant sketch pads). It also emphasizes only pulling in the data that is needed to meet the requirements. Then I use Powershell scripts to deploy and refresh the model. With different branches on Azure DevOps, I can deploy to dev, test, and production.    </p><p>My first models were built using Visual Studio. Some of which are still in Production.</p><p>We also build data models directly in Power BI.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="visualizing-the-data">Visualizing the Data<a class="hash-link" href="#visualizing-the-data" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We have Excel and Power BI as the clients connecting to the data model. There have been projects where the delivery method is Excel where using Cube Formulas was necessary to get the desired layout of the report. The goal is always to get as much into Power BI reports and dashboards so that the data can be looked at when needed and not require opening a file located on a file share. The hope is that it will empower others to start taking action on the insights gained and not spend so much time trying to wrangle the data themselves. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excel-and-beyond">Excel and Beyond<a class="hash-link" href="#excel-and-beyond" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I am a big fan of Power Query and love teaching people how to use it. I have done several lunch and learn events at work to teach Power Query. I believe that anyone that uses Excel on a daily can benefit from using Power Query.</p><p>We currently use Microsoft Team Foundation Server for source control but I am transitioning some of my projects to git using Azure DevOps. </p><p>On my list of what I am currently learning or need to get up to speed on is C# (mainly for automating the data model creation in Tabular Editor), React (website), Dataflows, and Power BI Premium. </p><p>I am using Windows Terminal and Visual Studio Code (in fact that is what I am writing my blog post with).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-passion">My Passion<a class="hash-link" href="#my-passion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>My first love is SQL which I still interact with daily, but I love working with the Tabular data model. My journey into business intelligence started with conversations with coworkers that were in Financial Planning and Analysis group. It started with trying to improve their quality of work life by finding solutions that could eliminate a lot of repetitive copying and pasting. It was through the relationship with the FP&amp;A group and their participation in the Nashville Excel user group that I was exposed to Power Pivot and Power Query. Once I started building data models I was hooked. It is an ongoing journey trying to keep up with the latest features in Power BI and other tools. It is a journey that I am glad to be on.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Experience with using Hugo and deploying to Github Pages.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sheep" src="/assets/images/Sheep_Sitting-c443581be4c430a965338b2810aef3b7.svg" width="94" height="116" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I would like to say that this blog has been relaunched on GitHub using Hugo. If something never launched in the first place I am not sure it can be relaunched.
I initially had a WordPress blog on SiteGround. It never made it out of test. I learned a lot about deploying WordPress and the different plugins. It did come
in handy when my work started using WordPress for the company site. One of the things I immediately noticed is our site did not have a Favicon. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hosting">Hosting<a class="hash-link" href="#hosting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Moving the blog to GitHub pages was motivated by a couple of factors. The first, it is hard to justify paying for hosting when nothing is being posted to the public.
When the renewal came due, it was time to try a different option.</p><p>The second reason is that by hosting it on GitHub it would encourage me to learn git. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="static-site-generator">Static Site Generator<a class="hash-link" href="#static-site-generator" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I chose Hugo as the static site generator for a couple reasons. It uses one executable for the program without a bunch of dependencies. It uses Go as the template
language and I was hoping for one that used a C like language. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hugo-theme">Hugo Theme<a class="hash-link" href="#hugo-theme" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Currently I am using the DPSG theme for Hugo. I had minimo while developing the site and then Mainroad. DPSG is a fork of Mainroad. I tend to fixate more on the theme
instead of the content. I am trying to stick with a theme until I create enough content. I am using Hugo modules for the theme. This makes it easy to update when a new
version of the theme comes out. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting<a class="hash-link" href="#syntax-highlighting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I am using <a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrismJS</a> for the syntax highlighting. Chroma which Hugo uses does not support languages such as DAX or M (Power Query). With PrismJS
you can select what languages and options you want to support and then add the references to the config file for the JS and CSS files.</p><p>I chose to setup my deployment using 3 repositories. I use one for the source code that has the visibility set to private. I deploy using a Bash script.  The repository
for the Public folder is using a git submodule and is set to public visibility. Lastly, I have public repository for the comments. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="comments">Comments<a class="hash-link" href="#comments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I am using <a href="https://utteranc.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">utterances</a> for the blog comments. It uses GitHub issues to store the blog comments. I still have the option to turn off blog comments on
a per post basis using the variable in the front matter.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tools">Tools<a class="hash-link" href="#tools" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To edit the markdown I use  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a>. It allows me to preview the code as I write. I use
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Terminal</a>which allows me to have multiple tabs open with Git Bash, PowerShell, and Command Prompt. Windows Terminal
is amazing and keeps getting better.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="art">Art<a class="hash-link" href="#art" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Profile picture and various art on the site is by <a href="https://www.how-to-draw-funny-cartoons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Bérubé</a>. I have zero artistic ability and really like his animated drawings.
When I first setup the blog on WordPress I used the drawing of the sheep as a placeholder for my profile picture - watermark and all. When it came time to pick the actual profile
picture I had become attached to the picture. I went ahead and purchased it from Martin.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-goal">My goal<a class="hash-link" href="#my-goal" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This is a place where I can discuss my journey with learning new topics on things that interest me. The main focus will be around the Microsoft BI Stack. Topics such as the
DAX language, DAX Studio, Tabular Editor, Analysis Services and Power BI. I also plan to discuss tools that help facilitate that journey such as Windows Terminal and Visual Studio
Code.</p>]]></content>
