        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My need for a mentor and my goals]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I didn't want to wait until the new year to start outlining my goals for 2023. Moreover, I did not want to wait till New Year's Day to start making progress on these goals. Going to PASS Summit I always return home inspired. Sometimes I don't even wait until I get back home to try some of the things I learned at Summit. I love being surrounded by others that share the same passion for the technology I work with. They challenge me to continue learning all that I can about the topics that I work with and that interest me. This time I left with a lot on my mind about speaking and blogging. What had I done since SQL Saturday Jacksonville 2022 to get closer to those goals?</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="areas-a-mentor-could-help">Areas a mentor could help<a class="hash-link" href="#areas-a-mentor-could-help" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Blogging</li><li>Speaking at conferences</li><li>Focus on a specific set of skills</li><li>Career Goals</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blogging-more">Blogging more<a class="hash-link" href="#blogging-more" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I have started on this goal. I know it is going to take repetition to get better and the discipline to set aside time to write. I have benefitted from using the blog to start capturing notes on things I am working on. I have found myself referencing those posts multiple times while working, but those posts are in draft mode and were never published online. I am working on going through them one by one and finishing each post. The reason I think blogging is beneficial is it forces me to know the subject I am writing on. I think a mentor could help with honest feedback on my writing and things like topic selection. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speaking-at-conferences">Speaking at conferences<a class="hash-link" href="#speaking-at-conferences" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Unfortunately, I have non-refundable reservations for the last weekend of February 2023 which rules out SQL Saturday Atlanta and Austin. My sights are set on SQL Saturday Jacksonville 2023. That may change as SQL Saturday conferences get announced that are earlier in the new year. I know this entails selecting good topics, submitting a session, and putting together presentations.   </p><p>Items I think a mentor would be valuable for:</p><ul><li>Topic selection</li><li>Submitting for a session is a technique of its own. Having someone that can advise the best way to go about this could increase my chances of getting chosen.
I know it could take submitting to an unknown amount of conferences until one of my sessions is picked</li><li>How best to go about putting together a session</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mvp">MVP<a class="hash-link" href="#mvp" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I did not list becoming an MVP as a goal. A friend gave me good advice that I should blog and or speak at conferences because it is what I like to do. It should not be that I am only doing these things to become an MVP. If it is a benefit down the road then all the better, but if it doesn't happen I am still doing things I enjoy and find satisfaction in. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-dont-know-what-i-dont-know">I don't know what I don't know<a class="hash-link" href="#i-dont-know-what-i-dont-know" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I have listed some reasons I think a mentor might help me on a path to better myself both personally and in my career. I know there are things that a mentor could help with that aren't obvious at this time. I can see myself looking back and saying that I didn't realize this certain thing was a result of having a mentor.   </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="specific-set-of-skills">Specific set of skills<a class="hash-link" href="#specific-set-of-skills" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The goal is to focus on a set of technologies that I want to have a depth of knowledge on. This one is difficult because there is a want to be able to fill all the needs myself that a job may have. We don't have someone that can do Power Apps so I will learn that or something like Biml can help me automate SSIS package creation, or I want to help us transition to Azure Data Factory. Meanwhile, there are features in the Tabular Data Model, DAX, and Power BI that I am not focusing on. I think the goal of blogging can help with this because it encourages me to take time to learn new features and try them myself. Same with speaking at conferences - if I want to speak about this new feature of DAX I better know it backward and forwards. This one is tough because you have to decide what would be beneficial to my focus such as learning Azure Synapse Analytics so I can integrate it with Power BI.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coach-at-the-gym">Coach at the gym<a class="hash-link" href="#coach-at-the-gym" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>One of the coaches asked each of us about our goals for the gym. He is helping us work towards reaching those stated goals. If the goal is to climb a rope then running a mile may be a positive step, it may help with cardio but it may not directly help reach that goal. Focusing on spending time on things that can get you closer to the goal would allow that goal to be reached more quickly. Having someone experienced show you the proper technique or ways to work more efficiently is invaluable. It wasn't until I was shown that the rope climb starts with the proper foot placement that I started to make progress. A lesson I learned was my goal may be to reach the top of the rope but first I must practice the proper form just with my feet before I go on to step 2. The two takeaways from this are that I need to focus on putting time into what will help me reach my goals and that I may need to focus on step 1 until I improve before I can move on to step 2.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="all-in">All in<a class="hash-link" href="#all-in" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Having a mentor is not about doing less work or cutting corners but having someone that can advise on the best way to go about achieving your goals. To have someone pass on what they learned the hard way is what I think this SQL community is all about. People helping other people be a better you.</p>]]></content>

        <id>/2022/12/14/Netsuite-SuiteAnalytics-StaticSchema</id>
        <link href="https://thedaxshepherd.net/2022/12/14/Netsuite-SuiteAnalytics-StaticSchema"/>
        <updated>2022-12-14T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[View all the tables in Netsuite new data source Netsuite2.com using the Static Schema.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="static-data-model">Static Data Model<a class="hash-link" href="#static-data-model" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Static Data Model can make working with the Netsuite SuiteAnalytics Connect new data source more informative. Regardless if you are just starting to use SuiteAnalytics for the first time or you are tasked with transitioning an existing project to the analytics data source. It is beneficial by allowing you to see all the tables and fields regardless if you have the necessary permissions. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="suiteanalytics-connect-data-source-change">SuiteAnalytics Connect data source change<a class="hash-link" href="#suiteanalytics-connect-data-source-change" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you use Netsuite SuiteAnalytics Connect to pull data from Netsuite to a data warehouse there has been a change in what data source you should be using. The Netsuite.com data source is being deprecated and will not be updated with new functionality. As of November 8, 2021 new users only have access to the Netsuite2.com data source. The preferred data source is the Netsuite2.com data source but it has a different schema and uses role-based permissions. More information regarding the deprecation of the NetSuite.com data source can be found here: <a href="https://suiteanswers.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/101873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuiteAnswers ID 101873</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="different-schema-and-permissions">Different schema and permissions<a class="hash-link" href="#different-schema-and-permissions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To start using the new data source you will have to figure out how to handle permissions and map out the new schema. You can use the Data Warehouse Integrator (DWI) role to access all tables but it requires token-based authentication. This limits how you can connect since the method needs to support the token-based authentication. Currently, the Netsuite provided ODBC drivers do not support using a token. An alternate method is to use the role-based permissions and build out access to the tables that are needed. However, trying to determine what tables are needed is not easy. Even with the knowledge of what it took to get a certain set of fields may have changed in the new data source. For example it may take two tables to get what you need for transactions in the Netsuite.com data source but takes at least three in Netsuite2.com to get the same information. </p><p>One method that can help is using what is called the Static Data Model to view all the tables in the new data source regardless of permissions. When making the transition to using the new data source it is helpful to see all the tables even if you do not have access to them. This facilitates the process of knowing what tables you need to request access to. If the Static Data Model is enabled you can see the structure and the name of all available record types and fields. If you do not have permission to the table it will return an empty table with no data. This is not a way to circumvent security and permissions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="missing-tables-from-the-er-diagram">Missing Tables from the ER Diagram<a class="hash-link" href="#missing-tables-from-the-er-diagram" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I setup two connections - one without the attribute and one with the attribute. I mainly use the connection without the attribute until I find I am missing a table and then I can confirm by going to the connection that has the attribute enabled. A recent example was I did not have access to the AccountingBook table. By going to the StaticSchema enabled connection I could confirm which tables I was missing. If you are using a tool like DBeaver and try to view the ER Diagram it will not show tables you do not have access to without using the StaticSchema attribute. For example even though the TransactionAccountingLine table has accountingBook as a composite primary key it will not display the accountingBook table in the ER diagram if you do not have permissions to the table.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="odbc-for-windows">ODBC for Windows<a class="hash-link" href="#odbc-for-windows" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There are many ways to connect to SuiteAnalytics Connect including ODBC (DSN and DSN-less), JDBC, and ADO.NET. For any of the methods that use a connection string it is as simple as adding the attribute to the connection string. If you are using Windows and want to add the attribute to ODBC drivers using a DSN connection you must use the Windows Registry Editor.</p><p>First, you need to create your ODBC connection. For my example I have created a 64 bit connection named Netsuite2_StaticSchema. I use the ODBC Data Source (64 bit) application in Windows to do this.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="ODBC" src="/assets/images/ODBC_Window-03a9ca6dee00b7ea7ebbf58caa85ae2b.png" width="610" height="437" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then we need to go to the Windows registry and edit the connection.</p><p>Open the Windows Registry Editor and go to the following folders:</p><p>32-bit drivers: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\ODBC\ODBC.INI.</p><p>64-bit drivers: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ODBC\ODBC.INI.</p><p>Find the ODBC connection that we created and then go to CustomProperties and add the attribute StaticSchema = 1;</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="RegEdit" src="/assets/images/Regedit-c191d403e215e6cbf1e2c813486bc928.png" width="1027" height="571" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>One thing to be aware of is after adding this attribute if you make any change to the ODBC connection such as renaming it - you will lose the attribute and need to add it back.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="odbc-for-linux">ODBC for Linux<a class="hash-link" href="#odbc-for-linux" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For Linux you need to edit the odbc<!-- -->[64]<!-- -->.ini or odbc.ini files to add the StaticSchema attribute to the CustomProperties. </p><p>CustomProperties=AccountID={accountID};RoleID={RoleID};Uppercase=1;StaticSchema=1;OAuth2Token={connection string value}</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="jdbc">JDBC<a class="hash-link" href="#jdbc" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For the JDBC connection you need to add the attribute to the connection string. It needs to be added to the CustomProperties in the order listed</p><p>CustomProperties=(AccountID={accountID};RoleID={RoleID};Uppercase=1;StaticSchema=1;OAuth2Token={connection string value})</p><p>For instance for my JDBC connection in DBeaver it looks like this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="JDBC-DBeaver"

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="intention">Intention<a class="hash-link" href="#intention" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Originally this started as a page on the website that did not change. The idea behind listing out what I was currently working on was that I would have a snapshot of the technology that I was currently using as well as what I was learning. But as I revisited this page, I realized it was going to change over time and really should be a blog post. A good example would be how when I started building Tabular Data Models I spent all my time in Visual Studio. Now I rarely open Visual Studio for developing the data models but still use it for SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="many-hats">Many Hats<a class="hash-link" href="#many-hats" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I work in a small IT shop. This means that I wear many hats. I gather requirements from the business, ETL, develop the data model, write the DAX code, and help with how the data will be presented on the canvas (usually Excel or Power BI). This also means understanding source systems like Netsuite ERP and how the data on the backend is structured. I also have to be self-motivated to learn new skills and apply them to projects I am working on.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sql-server-dba">SQL Server DBA<a class="hash-link" href="#sql-server-dba" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>My main role early on was that of a SQL Server DBA. We have internal applications using SQL Server for the databases. We do not have separate SQL developers so the responsibility of maintaining and fixing all of the SQL stored procedures was part of my responsibilities. I still perform that role in some capacity, but it is not my primary responsibility due to the growth of the Business Intelligence projects.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sql-server">SQL Server<a class="hash-link" href="#sql-server" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I use SQL Server Integration Services to pull the data from the source systems (Custom payroll application, Netsuite ERP, JD Edwards ERP) and store it in SQL Server. I create the databases, tables, and views that are needed.  </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="third-party-data-model-tools">Third-Party Data Model Tools<a class="hash-link" href="#third-party-data-model-tools" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I use DAX Studio for testing measures, performance tuning, and querying the data models. For building the data models I use a combination of tools including Tabular Editor, Model Auto Build, and Power BI Desktop. Some of the large models are then deployed to SQL Server Analysis Services. One of the tools I need to learn more about is Bravo.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-the-tabular-data-models">Building the Tabular Data Models<a class="hash-link" href="#building-the-tabular-data-models" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To build the tabular data models, I am using <a href="https://github.com/m-kovalsky/ModelAutoBuild" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model Auto Build</a> which uses an Excel file with the metadata in it. The author describes it as laying out a blueprint of the model before creating it. You can share the Excel file with the business as it gives them insight into what is being created. It is dependent on Tabular Editor to generate the necessary assets. Since it is essentially a C# script, I can make changes to the code if needed and also raise an issue with the author if any bugs are found. Because there is no GUI it requires me to visualize the model and draw out how it should look (yes, I use giant sketch pads). It also emphasizes only pulling in the data that is needed to meet the requirements. Then I use Powershell scripts to deploy and refresh the model. With different branches on Azure DevOps, I can deploy to dev, test, and production.    </p><p>My first models were built using Visual Studio. Some of which are still in Production.</p><p>We also build data models directly in Power BI.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="visualizing-the-data">Visualizing the Data<a class="hash-link" href="#visualizing-the-data" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We have Excel and Power BI as the clients connecting to the data model. There have been projects where the delivery method is Excel where using Cube Formulas was necessary to get the desired layout of the report. The goal is always to get as much into Power BI reports and dashboards so that the data can be looked at when needed and not require opening a file located on a file share. The hope is that it will empower others to start taking action on the insights gained and not spend so much time trying to wrangle the data themselves. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="excel-and-beyond">Excel and Beyond<a class="hash-link" href="#excel-and-beyond" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I am a big fan of Power Query and love teaching people how to use it. I have done several lunch and learn events at work to teach Power Query. I believe that anyone that uses Excel on a daily can benefit from using Power Query.</p><p>We currently use Microsoft Team Foundation Server for source control but I am transitioning some of my projects to git using Azure DevOps. </p><p>On my list of what I am currently learning or need to get up to speed on is C# (mainly for automating the data model creation in Tabular Editor), React (website), Dataflows, and Power BI Premium. </p><p>I am using Windows Terminal and Visual Studio Code (in fact that is what I am writing my blog post with).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-passion">My Passion<a class="hash-link" href="#my-passion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>My first love is SQL which I still interact with daily, but I love working with the Tabular data model. My journey into business intelligence started with conversations with coworkers that were in Financial Planning and Analysis group. It started with trying to improve their quality of work life by finding solutions that could eliminate a lot of repetitive copying and pasting. It was through the relationship with the FP&amp;A group and their participation in the Nashville Excel user group that I was exposed to Power Pivot and Power Query. Once I started building data models I was hooked. It is an ongoing journey trying to keep up with the latest features in Power BI and other tools. It is a journey that I am glad to be on.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Experience with using Hugo and deploying to Github Pages.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sheep" src="/assets/images/Sheep_Sitting-c443581be4c430a965338b2810aef3b7.svg" width="94" height="116" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I would like to say that this blog has been relaunched on GitHub using Hugo. If something never launched in the first place I am not sure it can be relaunched.
I initially had a WordPress blog on SiteGround. It never made it out of test. I learned a lot about deploying WordPress and the different plugins. It did come
in handy when my work started using WordPress for the company site. One of the things I immediately noticed is our site did not have a Favicon. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hosting">Hosting<a class="hash-link" href="#hosting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Moving the blog to GitHub pages was motivated by a couple of factors. The first, it is hard to justify paying for hosting when nothing is being posted to the public.
When the renewal came due, it was time to try a different option.</p><p>The second reason is that by hosting it on GitHub it would encourage me to learn git. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="static-site-generator">Static Site Generator<a class="hash-link" href="#static-site-generator" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I chose Hugo as the static site generator for a couple reasons. It uses one executable for the program without a bunch of dependencies. It uses Go as the template
language and I was hoping for one that used a C like language. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hugo-theme">Hugo Theme<a class="hash-link" href="#hugo-theme" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Currently I am using the DPSG theme for Hugo. I had minimo while developing the site and then Mainroad. DPSG is a fork of Mainroad. I tend to fixate more on the theme
instead of the content. I am trying to stick with a theme until I create enough content. I am using Hugo modules for the theme. This makes it easy to update when a new
version of the theme comes out. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting<a class="hash-link" href="#syntax-highlighting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I am using <a href="https://prismjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrismJS</a> for the syntax highlighting. Chroma which Hugo uses does not support languages such as DAX or M (Power Query). With PrismJS
you can select what languages and options you want to support and then add the references to the config file for the JS and CSS files.</p><p>I chose to setup my deployment using 3 repositories. I use one for the source code that has the visibility set to private. I deploy using a Bash script.  The repository
for the Public folder is using a git submodule and is set to public visibility. Lastly, I have public repository for the comments. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="comments">Comments<a class="hash-link" href="#comments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I am using <a href="https://utteranc.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">utterances</a> for the blog comments. It uses GitHub issues to store the blog comments. I still have the option to turn off blog comments on
a per post basis using the variable in the front matter.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tools">Tools<a class="hash-link" href="#tools" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>To edit the markdown I use  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a>. It allows me to preview the code as I write. I use
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Terminal</a>which allows me to have multiple tabs open with Git Bash, PowerShell, and Command Prompt. Windows Terminal
is amazing and keeps getting better.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="art">Art<a class="hash-link" href="#art" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Profile picture and various art on the site is by <a href="https://www.how-to-draw-funny-cartoons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Bérubé</a>. I have zero artistic ability and really like his animated drawings.
When I first setup the blog on WordPress I used the drawing of the sheep as a placeholder for my profile picture - watermark and all. When it came time to pick the actual profile
picture I had become attached to the picture. I went ahead and purchased it from Martin.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-goal">My goal<a class="hash-link" href="#my-goal" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This is a place where I can discuss my journey with learning new topics on things that interest me. The main focus will be around the Microsoft BI Stack. Topics such as the
DAX language, DAX Studio, Tabular Editor, Analysis Services and Power BI. I also plan to discuss tools that help facilitate that journey such as Windows Terminal and Visual Studio
Code.</p>]]></content>
